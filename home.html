                            My husband and I were looking for a big house as we were planning to expand our family. Alexandra 
                            listened to us carefully, took notes, and always stayed tuned! It's amazing but she found a good place
                            for us in one week. Affordable, near the good school, bus stop and plaza. Exactly what we wanted. She helped us
                            to prepare all the documents as well. Thank you!

                        <p class="feedback-text">I've never sold a house before... It was my first experience. Alexandra made evaluation of my property. 
                            If I did by myself I would definetely lose my money! I didn't know that my house can cost so much. She also explained the propcess of selling
                            the house and helped to find a new place!

                            As a businessman I don't have much time to sell house by myself. It demands a lot of time to meet with potential buyers,
                            agree with them, keep in touch. I asked for Alexandra's help. The result impressed me! She is reliable, has a big database of sellers 
                            and buyers, so she found buyers soon enough. Saved me a lot of time!
